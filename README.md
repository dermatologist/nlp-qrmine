QRMine is a suite of qualitative research (QR) data mining tools in Python using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). QRMine is work in progress. [Read More..](https://nuchange.ca/2017/09/grounded-theory-qualitative-research-python.html)

## What it does

### NLP
* [x] Lists common categories for open coding.
* [x] Create a coding dictionary with categories, properties and dimensions.
* [x] Topic modelling.
* [x] Arrange docs according to topics.
* [x] Compare two documents/interviews.
* [x] Select documents/interviews by sentiment, category or title for further analysis.
* [x] Sentiment analysis
* [ ] Network analysis
* [ ] Co-citation finder

### ML
* [x] Accuracy of a neural network model trained using the data
* [x] Confusion matrix from an support vector machine classifier
* [x] K nearest neighbours of a given record
* [x] K-Means clustering
* [x] Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* [x] Association rules

## How to install

```text

pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-2.3.0/en_core_web_sm-2.3.0.tar.gz#egg=en_core_web_sm
pip install qrmine

```
### Mac users
* Mac users, please install *libomp* for XGBoost
```
brew install libomp
```

## How to Use

* input files are transcripts as txt files and a single csv file with numeric data. The output txt file can be specified.

* The coding dictionary, topics and topic assignments can be created from the  entire corpus (all documents) using the respective command line options.

* Categories (concepts), summary and sentiment can be viewed for entire corpus or specific titles (documents) specified using the --titles switch. Sentence level sentiment output is possible with the --sentence flag.

* You can filter documents based on sentiment, titles or categories and do further analysis, using --filters or -f

* Many of the ML functions like neural network takes a second argument (-n) . In nnet -n signifies the number of epochs, number of clusters in kmeans, number of factors in pca, and number of neighbours in KNN. KNN also takes the --rec or -r argument to specify the record.

* Variables from csv can be selected using --titles (defaults to all). The first variable will be ignored (index) and the last will be the DV (dependant variable).


### Command-line options

```text
pythom -m qrmine --help

```

## Use it in your code
```python
from qrmine import Content
from qrmine import Network
from qrmine import Qrmine
from qrmine import ReadData
from qrmine import Sentiment
from qrmine import MLQRMine

```
* *More instructions and a jupyter notebook available [here.](https://nuchange.ca/2017/09/grounded-theory-qualitative-research-python.html)*

## Input file format

### NLP
Individual documents or interview transcripts in a single text file separated by <break>Topic</break>. Example below

```
Transcript of the first interview with John.
Any number of lines
<break>First_Interview_John</break>

Text of the second interview with Jane.
More text.
<break>Second_Interview_Jane</break>

....
```

Multiple files are suported, each having only one break tag at the bottom with the topic.
(The tag may be renamed in the future)

### ML

A single csv file with the following generic structure.

* Column 1 with identifier. If it is related to a text document as above, include the title.
* Last column has the dependent variable (DV). (NLP algorithms like the topic asignments may provide the DV)
* All independent variables (numerical) in between.

```
index, obesity, bmi, exercise, income, bp, fbs, has_diabetes
1, 0, 29, 1, 12, 120, 89, 1
2, 1, 32, 0, 9, 140, 92, 0
......

```
